# Pav

The project is 2D platformer with action elements and it was created during "Theory and practice of computer games" classes at AGH University.

Pav is clone of "Claw" (aka Captain Claw) game published by Monolith Productions in 1997.  
We proposed different scenario. In our version the bad guys - cats, captured poor traveler Pav - the dog and locked him up in the old castle cell.  
To get out player need 4 keys which will let him escape the scary place.
